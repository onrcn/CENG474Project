Since I've worked with more than one dataset and more than one model,
Unfortunately, I cannot send just two files. To make it work, I've compressed
the folder into a zip file for an easy access.

### Required Libraries:
- Tensorflow
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Numpy

You can change the python version from

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env python3.8
```

by just editting the .8
